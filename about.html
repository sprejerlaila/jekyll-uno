<b>About</b><br>

My name is Laila Sprejer and I'm an economist and a data scientist from Argentina, currently living in New York.<br>

My history with data started when I worked at (Nielsen)[https://www.nielsen.com/us/en.html] as a Technical Analyst for the modeling team in Argentina, when I was still in college. Until then, my only programming experience had been in high school, when we learned a little bit of Python. But at Nielsen we used SAS, and I couldn't be happier to get back to coding!
As part of my job, I analyzed and modeled retail sales to optimize price and promotion strategy 
for 10+ countries and 20+ brands including Coca Cola, Unilever, P&G and PepsiCo. I took part in standard and custom projects, process optimizations and automations, new analysts training and supervision, and received a promotion after a year.

After graduating from college and almost two years at Nielsen, an opportunity came up at (Despegar.com)[https://www.us.despegar.com/], the leading online travel agency in Latin America, to become their first Market Research Analyst. I was drawn by such a challenging position -and indeed it was, and the opportunity to work at an (Argentinian Unicorn)[https://www.thedigitalmarketingbureau.com/vintage-tdmb/latin-america-tech]. 
My team’s main goal was to understand Latin American travelers, for which we used survey data from 6 countries that we ourselves designed, programmed, and analyzed.
I got immediately involved in one of the largest projects of the company, which consisted on reorienting the whole company's value proposition, exposing myself to working with the CEO and some of the higher managers of the company. 
I implemented key driver analysis and satisfaction models, and advised managers 
across the organization on a range of business issues, including loyalty, marketing and user experience strategy. 

Inspired by the transformational power I saw data can have while simultaneously aware I needed to skill-up, I applied and was accepted into (Metis’ immerse data science bootcamp)[https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps]. The program centered around design and implementation of entire life-cycle projects, from data acquisition to statistical modeling and visualization.
During my time at Metis, I worked on predicting house pricing in Colorado using linear regression and scraped data from Zillow, used classification techniques to predict crime in London, and combined NLP and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze my own WhatsApp history. For my final project, I created a web-app that leverages seq2seq modeling to generate a harmony background for a melody. All the code I used and my final presentations are fully available in my (github)[https://github.com/sprejerlaila/]


This blog started as a way of sharing some of the projects I worked on during my time at Metis, but my goal is to take it beyond that and keep posting whatever interesting things I come across. I hope this is both fun and useful for you to read, and I’m more than happy to receive any comments or feedback you may have!
